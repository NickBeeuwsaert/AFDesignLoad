==================
AFDesign Extractor
==================
NOTE: This project is a work-in-progress.

Currently the extracting resources from a afdesign is working. but parsing the data further than that hasn't been accomplished yet.

Purpose
=======
It'd be useful to have a command line tool / library that will extract resources from a afdesign and convert each slice to a SVG/PNG/JPG/Whatever. 

Also: I like mucking around in file-formats.
